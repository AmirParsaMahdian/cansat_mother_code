This is the ultimate code for our CanSat.

It contains codes for GY-80 , NEO 6M , SI7021.

Some other sensors are first connected to the ATMega328 and then the data is
readed using the Nanopi Neo Air on the i2c bus.

It is better to make most of the changes here and then update changes in the 
Nanopi using " git pull " command.
